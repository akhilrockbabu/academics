'''Given three coordinate points A, B and C,
find the missing point D such that ABCD can be a parallelogram.
If there are multiple such points, find the lexicographically smallest coordinate.
Example 1:
Input:
A = (3, 2)
B = (3, 4)
C = (2,2)
Output:
2.000000 0.000000
Explanation: There are two options for point D: (2, 4) and (2, 0) such that ABCD forms a parallelogram. Since (2, 0) is lexicographically smaller than (2, 4). Hence,
(2, 0) Is the answer.'''
